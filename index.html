                    <h3>Balanced Diet</h3>
                    <p>A balanced diet is a diet that helps maintain or improve overall health. 
                        A balanced diet provides the body with essential nutrition: 
                        fluid, macronutrients, micronutrients, and adequate food energy.
                        A balanced diet may contain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, 
                        and may include little to no processed food or sweetened beverages. 
                        The requirements for a balanced diet can be met from a variety of plant-based 
                        and animal-based foods.</p>

                    <h3>Regular Exercise</h3>
                    <p>Exercise is defined as any movement that makes your muscles work and requires your body to burn calories.
                     There are many types of physical activity, including swimming, running, jogging, walking, and dancing, to name a few.
                        Being active has been shown to have many health benefits, both physically and mentally. It may even help you live longer</p>

                    <h3>Proper Sleep Scedule</h3>
                    <p>A good night’s sleep is just as important as regular exercise and a healthy diet.
                        Research shows that poor sleep has immediate negative effects on your hormones, exercise performance, and brain function
                        It can also cause weight gain and increase disease risk in both adults and children.
                        In contrast, good sleep can help you eat less, exercise better, and be healthier
                        Over the past few decades, both sleep quality and quantity has declined. In fact, many people regularly get poor sleep 
                        If you want to optimize your health or lose weight, getting a good night’s sleep is one of the most important things you can do</p>

                    <h3>De-Stress</h3>
                    <p>Stress is a daily emotion we feel; some of us more than others, which is true for the majority of the 
                        population that need to balance their careers and their personal lives.
                        A lot of people think since we always feel it, stress is something to accept. 
                        It’s true our tolerance for it seems to increase over time, but chronic stress has more 
                        substantial consequences than we imagine.
                        It can lead to many illnesses like heart disease and even cancer. 
                        It can also leave a negative impact on our lifestyles. 
                        That’s why it’s important to look for places to relieve our stress so that 
                        we can lead a happy and healthy in the long run</p>
