                     <h1>Does a healthy lifestyle make a difference?</h1>
                     <p>As it turns out, healthy habits make a big difference. 
                         According to this analysis, people who met criteria for all five habits enjoyed significantly, 
                         impressively longer lives than those who had none: 14 years for women and 12 years for men 
                         (if they had these habits at age 50). People who had none of these habits were far more 
                         likely to die prematurely from cancer or cardiovascular disease.
                        Study investigators also calculated life expectancy by how many of these five healthy habits people had.
                         Just one healthy habit (and it didn’t matter which one) … just one… 
                         extended life expectancy by two years in men and women. Not surprisingly, 
                         the more healthy habits people had, the longer their lifespan.
                          it confirms prior similar research — a lot of prior similar research. 
                          A 2017 study using data from the Health and Retirement Study found that people 50 
                          and older who were normal weight, had never smoked, and drank alcohol in moderation 
                          lived on average seven years longer. A 2012 mega-analysis of 15 international studies that 
                          included over 500,000 participants found that over half of premature deaths were due to 
                          unhealthy lifestyle factors such as poor diet, inactivity, obesity, excessive alcohol intake, 
                          and smoking. And the list of supporting research goes on.</p>

                     <h2>Balanced Diet</h2>
                     <p>Your heart, muscles, bones, immune system and other body systems depend on a continual supply of nutrients 
                         for cell growth and metabolism. You need to eat  varied diet to get   essential nutrients in the form of 
                         protein, vitamins, carbohydrates, minerals and fats. Consume lean meat  such as chicken along with legumes, 
                         eggs and   nuts for healthy living. Limit your portion size at meals to control your weight and your risk
                          for cardiovascular and other diseases through your lifestyle. If you want to control your weight and 
                          reduce the risk of various diseases, you   make sure that the diet is nutritious, in addition to limiting 
                          portion size.</p>

                     <p>Calories accompany the nutrition in food and if you don’t exercise, you’ll gain weight. 
                         Carrying extra weight increases your risk for heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer. 
                         Your lifestyle should support a constant healthy weight for normal daily activity. You should always 
                         do muscle strengthening exercises, such as weight lifting, along with aerobic exercises, such as walking or running. 
                         You should also include exercise, such as yoga to improve body flexibility.</p>

                          time of reduced physical activity. Seven to nine hours of night sleep daily is considered an optimum for

                     <p>Your body responds to everyday stress with a release of hormones that prepares you to react.
                         Although some stress is inevitable and necessary, excess can lead to various health problems.
                         If you don’t relieve this excessively stressful state through relaxation, the effects build and 
                         can create muscular pain, headaches, sleep disturbances and other symptoms. 
                         A lifestyle that includes regular stress management, breaks this cycle before 
                         it can progress to unhealthy levels. You can achieve physical relaxation through stretching, 
                         body massage, yoga or enjoyable exercise. Connect with friends and family to relieve mental pressures and 
                         take time out to read, pursue a hobby or experience another activity that makes you feel good.</p>
